# ==================================
# FRONTEND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
# ==================================
# For EC2 deployment, copy this to .env.production and set real values

# API base path for frontend (relative path via Next.js proxy)
# This should always be /api (no changes needed for different environments)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=/api

# Backend URL for server-side API proxy (NOT exposed to browser)
# In production on EC2, this stays as localhost:3000 because frontend and backend
# are on the same instance. The Next.js proxy at /app/api/[...path]/route.ts
# forwards all /api/* requests to this backend URL.
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Optional: Analytics, logging, etc.
