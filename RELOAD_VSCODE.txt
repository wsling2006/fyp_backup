VSCode is showing an OLD cached version (1599 lines) while the actual file has 1221 lines.

TO FIX THIS RIGHT NOW:

1. In VSCode, close the page.tsx tab (Cmd+W)
2. Press Cmd+Shift+P
3. Type: "Reload Window" 
4. Press Enter
5. Reopen frontend/app/purchase-requests/page.tsx

OR SIMPLY:

1. Close VSCode completely (Cmd+Q)
2. Reopen VSCode
3. Open the file again

This will force VSCode to read from disk and both will be in sync!
