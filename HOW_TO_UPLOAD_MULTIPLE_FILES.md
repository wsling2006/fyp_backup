## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: Can only select one file at a time**

**Solution 1: Make sure you're holding Ctrl/Cmd**
- ❌ Wrong: Click file 1 → Release → Click file 2 (only file 2 is selected)
- ✅ Correct: Click file 1 → **Hold Ctrl** → Click file 2 → Click file 3 → Release Ctrl

**Solution 2: Check the file picker window**
- Look at the bottom of the file picker dialog
- It should show: "3 files" or "5 files" etc.
- If it only shows one filename, you didn't hold Ctrl/Cmd properly

**Solution 3: Try drag and drop instead**
- Select files in your file manager first
- Then drag them all at once to the form

### **Problem: Files aren't showing in the list**

**Solution 1: Check the "Selected Files" section**
- After selecting files, scroll down
- You should see a gray box with all filenames listed
- If you don't see it, the files weren't selected

**Solution 2: Try clicking Choose Files again**
- Start fresh
- Hold Ctrl/Cmd from the start
- Select files one by one while holding the key

**Solution 3: Clear browser cache**
- Press Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows/Linux)
- Press Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Tip 1: Organize files first**
Before selecting:
- Put all files you want to upload in one folder
- Rename them clearly (e.g., 2026_Q1_Report.pdf)
- Sort by name or date

### **Tip 2: Check file sizes**
- Max 20MB per file
- If file is too large, compress it or split it
- Use PDF instead of Word for smaller size

### **Tip 3: Scan locally first**
- Run your own antivirus before uploading
- Saves time and prevents errors
- System will scan anyway, but this helps catch issues early

### **Tip 4: Use meaningful filenames**
- ✅ Good: "Q4_2025_Financial_Report.pdf"
- ❌ Bad: "document1.pdf"
- Your colleagues will thank you!
